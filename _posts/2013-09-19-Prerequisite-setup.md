# Install Git

To get started let's install the toolchain we'll use.

### Linux

On linux use your package manager to install git. This assumes Ubuntu Linux:

    apt-get install -y git

### Mac

Github for Mac is the easiest way to start using git visually. Download from
[Github for Mac's Page][gh-mac].

### Windows

Github for Windows is the easiest way to start using git visually. Download from
[Github for Windows's Page][gh-win].

### Virtualized

If you prefer an isolated environment to work from you can use virtualization.
This example uses [Virtualbox][vb] and [Vagrant][vagrant]. You will need to
download in install those softwares from their respective sites.

# Text Editor

You should have a text editor installed. We will use it to create and edit files
that will be added to our project. In Windows you may use notepad, in Mac you
may use TextEdit, and linux will have vim.
