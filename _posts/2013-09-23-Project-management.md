# Issues

On your github project page, there is a link on the right-hand side to issues.
Issues let you track bugs, work to be done, and other state-changing transitions
that need to be tackled.

The best way to use issues is by making a couple of labels. Github populates a
few of them, but you should decide which ones make sense for your project. Bug,
Question, and Enhancement (or Feature Request) usually make sense for any
project.

Open an issue for a new task to find phone numbers for one of your more elusive
friends and add it into the table. Use the markdown syntax to make style changes
into the description.

# Collaborators

You should add friends to your project. Anyone from the internet will be able to
open issues and propose pull requests to your project. Collaborators will be
able to assign issues to themselves and other collaborators, and merge pull
requests.

Add someone else in the room to your repository.

# Docs

Github has two amazing built-in features for documentation. The first is the
project wiki. It works like any wiki would, and uses markdown syntax for
introducing html markup into the page, giving you some control over style.

Github Pages is the second feature (and the one you are using *right now*) that
is great for documentation. A tool called jekyll can be used to manage those
pages, or you can just use static pages. Go to the settings section of your
repository and enable pages using the instructions.
