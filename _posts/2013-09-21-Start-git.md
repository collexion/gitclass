# Getting Help

There are many ways to perform operations. The steps here are based on personal
experience and are designed to be short and easy to use. To get more information
about any command just run `git help COMMAND`.

# Create a project on Github

Sign in to Github. At the top right you will see an icon to create a new repo.
Let's call this project "gitparty." Initialize the project with an empty README,
just to get us started more quickly.

# Copy the repository to your local machine

This is called a "clone" operation

    git clone git@github.com:USERNAME/gitparty.git

# Add some content to the README

Use your favorite text editor. For those using a linux image the easiest editor
may be "nano".

    nano README

# Tell git you have some changes

    git commit --all

# Put the changes where other people can access them (eg, the "origin")

    git push

# View your project on githib

Enjoy the pleasure that comes from sharing your work.

# Question

* Which command made the changes visible to github?
